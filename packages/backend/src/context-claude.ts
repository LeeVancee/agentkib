// Instructions as Claude Code loads them. The rules follow https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory:
// - Order, from broad to narrow: managed policy CLAUDE.md, the user's CLAUDE.md and rules, then
//   every directory from the file system root down to the working directory (CLAUDE.md,
//   .claude/CLAUDE.md, the always-on rules, CLAUDE.local.md), then auto memory. Rules with a
//   `paths` field load only when a matching file is read, so they are listed, not merged.
// - AGENTS.md and .claude/AGENTS.md are read only when no CLAUDE.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md or
//   CLAUDE.local.md exists in the working directory or any parent, from Claude Code 2.1.277.
//   Neither the user-level CLAUDE.md nor managed policy or rules count. The "Project
//   instructions" choice (settings, see claude-settings.ts) can read AGENTS.md always, never, or
//   leave out every file but the managed ones. claudeMdExcludes leaves out user, project and
//   local files, never the managed ones; the managed `claudeMd` key loads like the managed file.
// - An import is `@path` at the start of a line or after whitespace, anywhere in the line.
//   Relative paths resolve against the file that contains the import; absolute paths and `~/`
//   are allowed. Spaces are escaped with a backslash and a quoted path is not an import. Code
//   spans and fenced code blocks are skipped. Imports nest up to four hops.
// - Block-level HTML comments in CLAUDE.md files are removed before the text reaches the model.
// - Claude Code asks the user before loading imports outside the project. The preview has no such
//   step, so it filters and redacts what it reads there, and the MCP tool leaves it out.
//
// Everything outside the workspace (managed, user level, parent directories, auto memory, links
// that lead out) is read-only, bounded, filtered and redacted. What is read depends on the mode:
// `full` for the app and the CLI, `metadata` for the MCP tool (sizes and counts only, no text
// and no path), `none` for the Doctor (nothing outside the workspace is touched).
